## What we use

We use Github Pages hosted in a custom domain (http://www.worknenjoy.com) and Jekyll for choose the theme.

Jekyll is a Ruby framework that github supports to generate dinamic pages. If you know Wordpress (http://www.wordpress.com) I can tell you that it uses PHP in a Apache server. So Github host a complete website using Jekyll as template language.

The language is simple and is made by configuration files and plain html, css and js files.

Here are some projects that have used this Jekyll Theme:
